Once apon a time there was a boy. His father wus Fred. Fred wss a decent guy.
At least he liked to thinkk he was a decent guy. But given he iss up at 11 PM writin this story,
one wonders whether a better description of Fred is crazy. Regardles, Fred lives in Marblehead.
Fun factz: Marblehead iss only 13 miles from Boston but it sometimes takes an hour to get thre!
